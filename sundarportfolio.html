            Larry Page. On October 24, 2015, he stepped into the new position at the completion of the formation of

            Satya Nadella.

            lot of work Google does is to help Chinese companies. There are many small and medium-sized businesses in 
            China who take advantage of Google to get their products to many other countries outside of China."

            In December 2019, Pichai became the CEO of Alphabet Inc.


            Pichai delivers a speech virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival 2020.
            In December 2020, Pichai delivered a speech virtually at the Singapore FinTech Festival emphasizing inclusive 
            digital economy.

            The coronavirus outbreak has sped up the adoption of digital tools and trends by years........Southeast 
            Asia's Internet economy is currently on the verge of a massive transformation......more than 40 million people
            in the region connected to the Internet for the first time in 2020 â€“ four times as many as the year before....
            ..while Covid has accelerated the use of digital tools, it's also exposed how many people are still left 
            behind......some 1.7 billion people around the world are still unbanked, a huge portion of African households
            do not have access to broadband and millions of women entrepreneurs lack the same access to opportunity as
            their male counterparts.
            Pichai said at the conclusion of his speech,

            Our goal for the post-Covid world is to ensure the benefits of technology can be shared, as widely and equitably as possible. If we can do that, 2020 will be remembered not as the end of the world, but the beginning of a world that works better for everyone
